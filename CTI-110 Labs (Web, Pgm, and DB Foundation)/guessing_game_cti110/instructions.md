## Creating a Guessing Game

#### Instructions:

1.	Start your program by placing a comment at the top of the file. The comment should include your name.
2.	Declare two variables with reasonable names to hold values
3.	Use the Random function to populate the target number variable with a random number within a specified range.
4.	Prompt the user for a guess and store the response in the guessed number variable.
5.	Use a while loop to continue asking for a new guess as long as the guessed number doesn't match the target number and the user didn't guess -999.
6.	When the user finally guesses the correct number or enters -999, the program should verify whether the user has won (guessed the correct number) or quit (guessed -999).
7.	Display an appropriate message based on whether the user won or quit.
8.	You are required to include two test cases at the top of your program - one for testing the quit functionality and the other for testing the correct guess functionality.
