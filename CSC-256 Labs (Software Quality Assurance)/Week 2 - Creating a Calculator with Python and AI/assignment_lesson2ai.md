# Lesson 2: AI for Software Development

## Assignment Overview
In this assignment, you will develop a calculator program in Python while adhering to several coding principles and best practices, including SOLID principles, DRY, KISS, YAGNI, Law of Demeter, Composition over inheritance, Encapsulation, High Cohesion, Low Coupling, modular design, and OOP principles. The code should be easy to maintain, extend, and test using Pytest. You will use AI tools such as Chatgpt or Copilot in Windows to assist in your development process.

## Objectives
- Create a calculator program with basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) using the procedural paradigm.
- Ensure the design allows easy addition of features such as present value and mortgage payments in the future.
- Write unit tests using Pytest to test the code with minimal mocking.
- Refactor the code to meet the specified principles and best practices.
- Add a new feature that requires a database or JSON file and modularize the code.
Discuss potential refactoring needed to turn the program into a web application in the future.

NOTES:

- **use the same chat window for all the prompts**

- **remember code can be put in a language block using triple backticks**


## Steps to Complete
1. Create a Markdown File:
   - Create a file named `lastname-lesson2ai.md.`
   - In this file, document all prompts and feedback given by the AI.

2. Initial Prompt:
   - I want to create a calculator program in python using the procedural paradigm. Initially, the feature will be for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. I will add other features such as present value, mortgage payments, etc. later so the design must easily allow this.
   - Add the prompt and feedback to your `lastname-lesson2ai.md`

3. Second Prompt (Unit Testing):
   - Can unit tests using `Pytest` be created to test the code easily with minimum mocking?
   - Add the prompt and feedback to your `lastname-lesson2ai.md`

4. Third Prompt (Refactoring Prompt):
   - Does the code meet the following principles? If not, where and how do I refactor? Code that meets SOLID principles as well as DRY, KISS, YAGNI, Law of Demeter, Composition over inheritance, Encapsulation, High Cohesion, Low Coupling, modular design, OOP principles. Code should be easy to maintain, easy to add features, and easy to test using `Pytest`.
   - Add the prompt and feedback to your `lastname-lesson2ai.md`

5. Fourth Prompt (Feature Addition and Modularization Prompt):
   - Add a new feature that would require a database or JSON file. Modularize the code into at least four modules to help in team development, testing, maintenance, and minimizing refactoring while adding features.
   - Add the prompt and feedback to your `lastname-lesson2ai.md`

6. Fifth Prompt (Web Application Refactoring Prompt):
   - If I wanted to eventually turn this into a web application, what refactoring should I do to allow this in the future?
   - Add the prompt and feedback to your `lastname-lesson2ai.md`

7. Your Choice:
   - Use this prompt for any additional questions or clarifications you need from the AI.
   - Add the prompt and feedback to your `lastname-lesson2ai.md`

8. Discussion Board Summary:
   - Write a 750-word summary of your process, what you did, and what you learned.

## Submission Guidelines
- Markdown File: `lastname-lesson2ai.md` should include all AI prompts and feedback.
- Summary: 750-word summary in the discussion board post.
- Attachment: Attach `lastname-lesson2ai.md` to your post.

## Evaluation Criteria:
Clear and comprehensive summary.
Proper documentation of AI interactions in the markdown file.
