## First Prompt
I want to create a calculator program in python using the procedural paradigm. Initially, the feature will be for addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. I will add other features such as present value, mortgage payments, etc. later so the design must easily allow this.

### AI Feedback
Here's a basic structure for your calculator program using the procedural paradigm. The design will be flexible enough to allow for adding more features later.

### Initial Version (Basic Operations)

```python
def add(x, y):
    return x + y

def subtract(x, y):
    return x - y

def multiply(x, y):
    return x * y

def divide(x, y):
    if y != 0:
        return x / y
    else:
        return "Error! Division by zero."

def calculator():
    print("Select operation:")
    print("1. Add")
    print("2. Subtract")
    print("3. Multiply")
    print("4. Divide")
    
    choice = input("Enter choice(1/2/3/4): ")

    num1 = float(input("Enter first number: "))
    num2 = float(input("Enter second number: "))

    if choice == '1':
        print(f"{num1} + {num2} = {add(num1, num2)}")
    elif choice == '2':
        print(f"{num1} - {num2} = {subtract(num1, num2)}")
    elif choice == '3':
        print(f"{num1} * {num2} = {multiply(num1, num2)}")
    elif choice == '4':
        print(f"{num1} / {num2} = {divide(num1, num2)}")
    else:
        print("Invalid input")

# Run the calculator
calculator()
```

### Future Design Considerations
When you want to add features like present value or mortgage payments, you can create separate functions for those calculations and simply add them to the menu.

Example:

```python
def present_value(...):
    # Future implementation

def mortgage_payment(...):
    # Future implementation

def calculator():
    # Add new options to the menu
    print("5. Present Value")
    print("6. Mortgage Payment")
    # Include logic for new operations
```

This design allows you to extend the functionality easily by adding more functions and expanding the menu options.

## Second Prompt
Can unit tests using `pytest` be created to test the code easily with minimum mocking?

### AI Feedback
Yes! You can create unit tests using `pytest` to test your calculator functions without much mocking because the functions operate directly on the input/output values. Here's how you can structure the tests:

### Installing Pytest (if not installed)
First, ensure you have `pytest` installed by running:
```bash
pip install pytest
```

### Writing Unit Tests

You can create a `test_calculator.py` file to hold the tests for your calculator functions. Since these functions only take inputs and return outputs, testing them is straightforward.

Here’s an example of how to write the tests:

```python
import pytest
from calculator import add, subtract, multiply, divide

# Test cases for addition
def test_add():
    assert add(2, 3) == 5
    assert add(-1, 1) == 0
    assert add(0, 0) == 0
    assert add(-5, -5) == -10

# Test cases for subtraction
def test_subtract():
    assert subtract(5, 3) == 2
    assert subtract(-1, -1) == 0
    assert subtract(0, 5) == -5
    assert subtract(5, 0) == 5

# Test cases for multiplication
def test_multiply():
    assert multiply(2, 3) == 6
    assert multiply(-1, 1) == -1
    assert multiply(0, 10) == 0
    assert multiply(-2, -2) == 4

# Test cases for division
def test_divide():
    assert divide(6, 3) == 2
    assert divide(5, 2) == 2.5
    assert divide(-10, 2) == -5
    assert divide(0, 1) == 0

    # Test division by zero
    assert divide(5, 0) == "Error! Division by zero."
```

### Running the Tests

Once you've written the test cases, you can run the tests by running the following command in the terminal:

```bash
pytest
```

### Explanation

- **No Mocking Needed**: Since these functions are pure (i.e., they don't interact with external systems like databases or APIs), there's no need for mocking. You're just passing inputs and checking if the outputs match the expected results.
  
- **Edge Cases**: For example, in the `divide()` function, we handle the "division by zero" case. This can be tested directly with simple input/output checks, as shown above.

### Adding More Tests Later

When you add new features like present value or mortgage payments, you can easily write similar tests. For instance, if you implement a mortgage payment function:

```python
def test_mortgage_payment():
    assert mortgage_payment(principal=100000, rate=5, years=30) == expected_value
```

This structure scales easily and keeps your tests clean and readable.

## Third Prompt
Does the code meet the following principles? If not, where and how do I refactor? Code that meets SOLID principles as well as DRY, KISS, YAGNI, Law of Demeter, Composition over inheritance, Encapsulation, High Cohesion, Low Coupling, modular design, OOP principles. Code should be easy to maintain, easy to add features, and easy to test using `Pytest`.

### AI Feedback
To meet the principles you've outlined (SOLID, DRY, KISS, YAGNI, etc.), we need to refactor the calculator program to adopt Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). Let's go through each principle and apply it step by step:

### SOLID Principles

1. **Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**:
   Each class should have one responsibility. The calculator will have separate classes for operations, ensuring each one only handles its respective task.

2. **Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**:
   Your system should be open for extension but closed for modification. New features (like present value calculations) can be added by creating new classes, without modifying existing ones.

3. **Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**:
   Derived classes should be able to replace their base class without affecting the program. We'll structure the classes to ensure this.

4. **Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**:
   Clients shouldn't depend on methods they don't use. We'll define interfaces or abstract base classes to make this possible.

5. **Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**:
   High-level modules shouldn't depend on low-level modules but on abstractions. We'll use dependency injection where necessary.

### Other Principles

- **DRY** (Don't Repeat Yourself): We'll refactor common code into shared methods.
- **KISS** (Keep It Simple, Stupid): Keep logic clear and avoid over-engineering.
- **YAGNI** (You Ain't Gonna Need It): Only add features when they're necessary.
- **Law of Demeter**: Objects should only talk to their direct dependencies.
- **Composition Over Inheritance**: Prefer using composition rather than inheritance for code reuse.
- **Encapsulation**: We’ll encapsulate the functionality within classes.
- **High Cohesion, Low Coupling**: We’ll aim for classes that do one thing and depend on as few other classes as possible.
- **Modular Design**: The code will be broken down into smaller, testable modules.

### Refactored Code

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Operation(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def execute(self, x, y):
        pass

class Addition(Operation):
    def execute(self, x, y):
        return x + y

class Subtraction(Operation):
    def execute(self, x, y):
        return x - y

class Multiplication(Operation):
    def execute(self, x, y):
        return x * y

class Division(Operation):
    def execute(self, x, y):
        if y != 0:
            return x / y
        else:
            raise ValueError("Cannot divide by zero")

class Calculator:
    def __init__(self):
        self.operations = {}

    def add_operation(self, name, operation: Operation):
        self.operations[name] = operation

    def execute_operation(self, name, x, y):
        if name in self.operations:
            return self.operations[name].execute(x, y)
        else:
            raise ValueError("Operation not supported")

# Testing the calculator
if __name__ == "__main__":
    calculator = Calculator()
    calculator.add_operation("add", Addition())
    calculator.add_operation("subtract", Subtraction())
    calculator.add_operation("multiply", Multiplication())
    calculator.add_operation("divide", Division())
    
    try:
        result = calculator.execute_operation("add", 5, 3)
        print(f"Addition result: {result}")
        
        result = calculator.execute_operation("divide", 10, 0)  # This will raise an exception
        print(f"Division result: {result}")
    except ValueError as e:
        print(e)
```

### Applying the Principles

1. **Single Responsibility**:
   - Each operation (Addition, Subtraction, etc.) is encapsulated in its own class, making the code easier to manage and extend.

2. **Open/Closed**:
   - The `Calculator` class is open for extension. You can add more operations like `MortgagePayment` without changing the existing code.

3. **Liskov Substitution**:
   - Any operation class can be substituted for another as long as it implements the `Operation` interface.

4. **Interface Segregation**:
   - Each operation class only implements the `execute` method it needs.

5. **Dependency Inversion**:
   - The `Calculator` class depends on the `Operation` abstraction, not concrete classes, allowing for easy extensions.

### Encapsulation, High Cohesion, Low Coupling, and Composition
- **Encapsulation**: The details of each operation are encapsulated in individual classes.
- **High Cohesion**: Each class has a well-defined responsibility (e.g., `Addition` only adds).
- **Low Coupling**: The `Calculator` class doesn't need to know how the operations work, just that they implement the `execute` method.
- **Composition Over Inheritance**: We compose functionality by adding operations to the `Calculator` instead of using inheritance.

### DRY and KISS
- **DRY**: No repeated code across operations, since each operation is defined once.
- **KISS**: Simple class structure for operations keeps the code clean and easy to understand.

### Adding Features and Testing with Pytest

To add a new feature (e.g., mortgage calculation), you just need to create a new class that inherits from `Operation`:

```python
class MortgagePayment(Operation):
    def execute(self, principal, rate, years):
        # Implement mortgage payment calculation
        pass
```

Then, add it to the calculator:

```python
calculator.add_operation("mortgage", MortgagePayment())
```

### Unit Tests with Pytest

You can create unit tests just like before, but now for individual classes:

```python
import pytest
from calculator import Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division

def test_addition():
    assert Addition().execute(2, 3) == 5

def test_division_by_zero():
    with pytest.raises(ValueError, match="Cannot divide by zero"):
        Division().execute(10, 0)
```

### Conclusion

The refactored code now follows SOLID principles, is easy to maintain and extend, and can be tested thoroughly with `pytest`. The modular design ensures low coupling, high cohesion, and makes adding new features straightforward.

## Fourth Prompt
Add a new feature that would require a database or JSON file. Modularize the code into at least four modules to help in team development, testing, maintenance, and minimizing refactoring while adding features.

### AI Feedback
Let's add a new feature to the calculator program: **Historical Results Logging**, where each operation's result is saved to a database or a JSON file for later retrieval.

We'll modularize the code into four distinct modules:

1. **Operations Module**: Handles mathematical operations like addition, subtraction, etc.
2. **Calculator Module**: Acts as the core of the calculator, orchestrating the execution of operations.
3. **Data Storage Module**: Manages saving and retrieving operation results to/from a database or JSON file.
4. **Application Module**: Acts as the entry point and ties everything together.

Here’s the implementation with four modules:

### 1. **Operations Module (`operations.py`)**
This module will handle the core operations (addition, subtraction, etc.).

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Operation(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def execute(self, x, y):
        pass

class Addition(Operation):
    def execute(self, x, y):
        return x + y

class Subtraction(Operation):
    def execute(self, x, y):
        return x - y

class Multiplication(Operation):
    def execute(self, x, y):
        return x * y

class Division(Operation):
    def execute(self, x, y):
        if y != 0:
            return x / y
        else:
            raise ValueError("Cannot divide by zero")
```

### 2. **Calculator Module (`calculator.py`)**
This module will orchestrate the operations and communicate with the storage module.

```python
from operations import Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division

class Calculator:
    def __init__(self, storage):
        self.operations = {}
        self.storage = storage

    def add_operation(self, name, operation):
        self.operations[name] = operation

    def execute_operation(self, name, x, y):
        if name in self.operations:
            result = self.operations[name].execute(x, y)
            self.storage.save_result(name, x, y, result)
            return result
        else:
            raise ValueError("Operation not supported")
```

### 3. **Data Storage Module (`storage.py`)**
This module will handle the saving and retrieving of data from a JSON file or database.

```python
import json

class Storage:
    def __init__(self, file_path="history.json"):
        self.file_path = file_path

    def save_result(self, operation, x, y, result):
        entry = {
            "operation": operation,
            "x": x,
            "y": y,
            "result": result
        }
        try:
            with open(self.file_path, "r") as file:
                data = json.load(file)
        except FileNotFoundError:
            data = []

        data.append(entry)

        with open(self.file_path, "w") as file:
            json.dump(data, file, indent=4)

    def get_history(self):
        try:
            with open(self.file_path, "r") as file:
                data = json.load(file)
            return data
        except FileNotFoundError:
            return []

    def clear_history(self):
        with open(self.file_path, "w") as file:
            json.dump([], file, indent=4)
```

### 4. **Application Module (`app.py`)**
This module ties everything together and serves as the entry point for the calculator application.

```python
from operations import Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division
from calculator import Calculator
from storage import Storage

if __name__ == "__main__":
    storage = Storage()
    calculator = Calculator(storage)

    # Registering operations
    calculator.add_operation("add", Addition())
    calculator.add_operation("subtract", Subtraction())
    calculator.add_operation("multiply", Multiplication())
    calculator.add_operation("divide", Division())

    # Execute some operations
    try:
        result = calculator.execute_operation("add", 5, 3)
        print(f"Addition result: {result}")

        result = calculator.execute_operation("subtract", 10, 4)
        print(f"Subtraction result: {result}")
        
        # Print history
        history = storage.get_history()
        print("History:", history)

        # Clear history
        storage.clear_history()
        print("History cleared.")
    except ValueError as e:
        print(e)
```

### Explanation of the Modules

1. **Operations (`operations.py`)**: This handles the mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, etc.), encapsulated in their respective classes, following the Single Responsibility Principle.
2. **Calculator (`calculator.py`)**: The calculator is responsible for managing operations, delegating execution, and using the storage system for logging results.
3. **Storage (`storage.py`)**: This is responsible for persisting data to a JSON file. It can be swapped with a database solution later (using an interface for extensibility).
4. **Application (`app.py`)**: This is the entry point where everything is initialized and runs. It ties together the operations, calculator, and storage modules.

### Extensibility and Refactoring

- **Modular Design**: The code is modularized into four logical modules. Teams can work independently on different modules (e.g., one team works on `operations.py`, while another works on `storage.py`).
- **Maintainability**: Future changes (e.g., adding new operations or switching to a database) can be isolated within individual modules without affecting the others.
- **High Cohesion and Low Coupling**: Each module has a specific responsibility and only interacts with the necessary dependencies.
- **Easy Testing**: Unit tests can be created for each module independently, making the code easier to test.

### Example Unit Test for Storage Module

Here’s an example `pytest` test for the storage module:

```python
import pytest
import os
import json
from storage import Storage

@pytest.fixture
def storage():
    return Storage(file_path="test_history.json")

def test_save_result(storage):
    storage.clear_history()
    storage.save_result("add", 5, 3, 8)
    
    history = storage.get_history()
    assert len(history) == 1
    assert history[0]["operation"] == "add"
    assert history[0]["result"] == 8

def test_clear_history(storage):
    storage.clear_history()
    
    history = storage.get_history()
    assert len(history) == 0

# Cleanup test file
@pytest.fixture(scope="module", autouse=True)
def cleanup_test_file():
    yield
    os.remove("test_history.json")
```

### Conclusion

This refactoring improves modularity, allows teams to work independently, adheres to SOLID principles, and enables future features like a database switch without significant refactoring. The code is maintainable, extensible, and easy to test with minimal refactoring.

## Fifth Prompt
If I wanted to eventually turn this into a web application, what refactoring should I do to allow this in the future?

### AI Feedback
To future-proof your calculator program for eventual conversion into a web application, you'll need to refactor and modularize your code so it can be easily integrated with a web framework. Here are key areas to focus on:

### 1. **Separation of Concerns**
   - Refactor your code to strictly separate the core business logic from any input/output concerns. This will make it easier to adapt the program for web requests and responses.
   - The calculator logic (operations, calculations, and storage) should be encapsulated in services or models that can be reused across different interfaces (CLI, web, etc.).

### 2. **Encapsulate Logic in Services/Modules**
   - Move the business logic into services (e.g., a `CalculatorService` that handles operations) so that the web layer can interact with these services instead of directly manipulating the data.
   - The current operations module can remain largely the same, but you may need to create service classes that expose methods that will be called by your web application controllers or views.

### 3. **Refactor for Dependency Injection**
   - Use dependency injection to pass dependencies like storage or operations into your classes. This allows for easier testing and makes it simpler to integrate a web framework that typically supports dependency injection (like Flask or Django).

### 4. **Decouple from Specific Storage Solutions**
   - Your current implementation is using JSON files for storage. While this works for a CLI, web applications typically use databases like SQLite, MySQL, or PostgreSQL. Implement an abstraction layer (e.g., a repository pattern) that will allow you to swap out the storage mechanism later with minimal refactoring.
   - For now, you can use an interface or abstract class for `Storage`, which will later be implemented with database interactions.

### 5. **Handle Asynchronous Operations**
   - Web applications often benefit from asynchronous handling of operations, especially when dealing with long-running tasks (like complex calculations or external API requests). Consider refactoring to make your code more compatible with async frameworks like `FastAPI` or making some parts of the application (e.g., storage) asynchronously callable.

### 6. **Prepare for Web-Specific Error Handling**
   - The error handling in a CLI application may differ from that in a web application. In a web app, you might want to throw specific HTTP error codes (e.g., `400 Bad Request`, `500 Internal Server Error`) instead of exceptions. Start refactoring your exception handling to distinguish between business logic errors and system errors, making it easier to adapt this handling in a web layer.

### 7. **Modularize Business Logic into Services**
   - Split your code into services or "managers" that represent specific domains of functionality. For example:
     - `CalculatorService`: Handles the operations and calculations.
     - `HistoryService`: Handles the logging and retrieval of historical data.

### 8. **Refactor into an MVC Structure**
   - Start refactoring your application into an MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture, which is typical in web applications. In this structure:
     - **Model**: Represents your data (e.g., results history, operations).
     - **View**: Handles rendering the UI (for a web app, this would be HTML templates or JSON responses).
     - **Controller**: Processes user input and interacts with the model to perform actions (in this case, mathematical operations).

### Example Refactoring

Here’s a rough idea of how to refactor the program to support future conversion into a web application.

#### 1. **Service Layer (`services.py`)**
   - This layer encapsulates the core logic for operations and history storage, separating it from any specific UI or framework concerns.

```python
from operations import Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division
from storage import Storage

class CalculatorService:
    def __init__(self, storage: Storage):
        self.storage = storage
        self.operations = {
            "add": Addition(),
            "subtract": Subtraction(),
            "multiply": Multiplication(),
            "divide": Division()
        }

    def calculate(self, operation_name, x, y):
        if operation_name in self.operations:
            result = self.operations[operation_name].execute(x, y)
            self.storage.save_result(operation_name, x, y, result)
            return result
        else:
            raise ValueError("Operation not supported")
```

#### 2. **Storage Interface (`storage.py`)**
   - Abstract the storage mechanism to prepare for future implementations (e.g., database, cloud storage).

```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Storage(ABC):
    @abstractmethod
    def save_result(self, operation, x, y, result):
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def get_history(self):
        pass

    @abstractmethod
    def clear_history(self):
        pass

class JSONStorage(Storage):
    # Same JSON implementation as before
    pass

class DatabaseStorage(Storage):
    # Future implementation for databases
    pass
```

#### 3. **Web-Specific Layer (Later)**
   - When you are ready to build the web layer, you can write a simple Flask app that interacts with the `CalculatorService`.

```python
from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
from services import CalculatorService
from storage import JSONStorage

app = Flask(__name__)
storage = JSONStorage()  # Or switch to a database storage later
calculator_service = CalculatorService(storage)

@app.route('/calculate', methods=['POST'])
def calculate():
    data = request.json
    operation = data.get("operation")
    x = data.get("x")
    y = data.get("y")
    
    try:
        result = calculator_service.calculate(operation, x, y)
        return jsonify({"result": result})
    except ValueError as e:
        return jsonify({"error": str(e)}), 400

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```

### Additional Considerations for Web Applications

1. **Database Integration**: When moving to a web app, you'll likely want to swap out JSON storage for a relational database (e.g., SQLite or PostgreSQL). This can be achieved by implementing a `DatabaseStorage` class that interacts with an ORM (e.g., SQLAlchemy).

2. **Session Management**: Web applications often need to manage user sessions, which requires handling user-specific data, such as a history of operations. You may need to refactor the storage layer to support multiple users.

3. **Async Support**: If the web application scales, consider switching to async frameworks like `FastAPI`, where asynchronous handling of requests is more efficient, especially for I/O-bound tasks.

4. **Frontend**: In a full-stack web app, you'll eventually need to create a frontend (using a framework like React or just vanilla JavaScript) to interact with your Flask/Django/FAST API backend.

### Conclusion

To refactor your calculator for web readiness:
- **Encapsulate business logic into services** for reusability across interfaces (CLI, web, etc.).
- **Use an interface for storage** to allow for future database integration without significant refactoring.
- **Keep your core logic framework-agnostic**, so it can be reused by different types of interfaces.
- **Prepare for a web framework** like Flask, Django, or FastAPI by refactoring your exception handling, service structure, and dependency injection to fit their paradigms.

This will ensure your calculator program is maintainable and scalable when you decide to transition it into a web application.

## Your Choice Prompt
If I wanted to use a diferent web framework, what should I do to implement Django instead?

### AI Feedback
To implement your calculator program using Django, you'll need to make some modifications to your existing structure to fit Django's framework. Django follows the **Model-View-Template (MVT)** pattern, which is similar to MVC but with slight differences. Here’s what you'll need to do:

### Steps to Implement the Calculator Program in Django

1. **Set up a Django Project and App**
   - Start by creating a new Django project and app:
     ```bash
     django-admin startproject calculator_project
     cd calculator_project
     python manage.py startapp calculator
     ```

2. **Modify the Service Layer to Use Django's MVT Structure**
   - The core logic (CalculatorService, Operations) will remain mostly the same, but you’ll organize them into Django views, models, and possibly forms, depending on the scope of the application.

3. **Create Views for Calculator Operations**
   - Instead of a Flask `@route` decorator, Django uses a more explicit view system. These views can be function-based views (FBVs) or class-based views (CBVs).

4. **Define URLs**
   - Django requires a `urls.py` file that maps URLs to the corresponding views.

5. **Create Templates**
   - Templates will render the calculator interface using HTML and Django’s templating language.

6. **Use Django's ORM for Storage**
   - Replace the JSON storage system with Django’s ORM to store historical calculations in a database.

### Refactoring the Code for Django

1. **Service Layer (services.py)**
   - This remains almost identical to the one you've already implemented, except you'll call it from Django views.

```python
from operations import Addition, Subtraction, Multiplication, Division

class CalculatorService:
    def __init__(self):
        self.operations = {
            "add": Addition(),
            "subtract": Subtraction(),
            "multiply": Multiplication(),
            "divide": Division()
        }

    def calculate(self, operation_name, x, y):
        if operation_name in self.operations:
            return self.operations[operation_name].execute(x, y)
        else:
            raise ValueError("Operation not supported")
```

2. **Models (`models.py`)**
   - You'll use Django’s ORM to store historical results. Here's an example of how you can define the model:

```python
from django.db import models

class CalculationHistory(models.Model):
    operation = models.CharField(max_length=20)
    x = models.FloatField()
    y = models.FloatField()
    result = models.FloatField()
    timestamp = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)

    def __str__(self):
        return f"{self.operation} of {self.x} and {self.y} = {self.result}"
```

3. **Views (`views.py`)**
   - Your views will interact with the `CalculatorService` and the models to execute operations and store/retrieve data.

```python
from django.shortcuts import render
from django.http import JsonResponse
from .models import CalculationHistory
from .services import CalculatorService

def calculate_view(request):
    if request.method == 'POST':
        operation = request.POST.get('operation')
        x = float(request.POST.get('x'))
        y = float(request.POST.get('y'))

        calculator = CalculatorService()
        try:
            result = calculator.calculate(operation, x, y)
            # Save to the database
            history = CalculationHistory(operation=operation, x=x, y=y, result=result)
            history.save()

            return JsonResponse({'result': result})
        except ValueError as e:
            return JsonResponse({'error': str(e)}, status=400)

    return render(request, 'calculator/calculate.html')
```

4. **URLs (`urls.py`)**
   - Set up a `urls.py` file inside your app to map the views to URLs.

```python
from django.urls import path
from . import views

urlpatterns = [
    path('calculate/', views.calculate_view, name='calculate'),
]
```

5. **Templates (`templates/calculator/calculate.html`)**
   - Create a form in a Django template that allows users to input numbers and select operations. Django’s templating language will render this to the user.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Calculator</title>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Calculator</h1>
    <form method="POST" action="{% url 'calculate' %}">
        {% csrf_token %}
        <label for="operation">Operation:</label>
        <select name="operation" id="operation">
            <option value="add">Add</option>
            <option value="subtract">Subtract</option>
            <option value="multiply">Multiply</option>
            <option value="divide">Divide</option>
        </select>
        <br>
        <label for="x">First Number:</label>
        <input type="number" name="x" id="x" required>
        <br>
        <label for="y">Second Number:</label>
        <input type="number" name="y" id="y" required>
        <br>
        <button type="submit">Calculate</button>
    </form>

    {% if result %}
        <h2>Result: {{ result }}</h2>
    {% endif %}

</body>
</html>
```

6. **Database Setup**
   - With Django’s ORM in place, you’ll need to migrate the database to create the `CalculationHistory` model:
     ```bash
     python manage.py makemigrations
     python manage.py migrate
     ```

7. **Testing with Django**
   - You can test Django views using Django’s built-in test framework. Here’s an example of testing the calculation view:

```python
from django.test import TestCase
from django.urls import reverse

class CalculatorTests(TestCase):
    def test_addition(self):
        response = self.client.post(reverse('calculate'), {
            'operation': 'add',
            'x': 5,
            'y': 3
        })
        self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 200)
        self.assertEqual(response.json()['result'], 8)

    def test_divide_by_zero(self):
        response = self.client.post(reverse('calculate'), {
            'operation': 'divide',
            'x': 5,
            'y': 0
        })
        self.assertEqual(response.status_code, 400)
        self.assertIn('error', response.json())
```

### Summary of Key Changes for Django

- **Views**: Replace Flask’s route handlers with Django views (`views.py`).
- **Templates**: Use Django templates for rendering the HTML form and displaying results.
- **URLs**: Map URLs to views using Django's `urls.py`.
- **Models**: Use Django's ORM to store and manage data.
- **Forms**: Optionally, you can refactor the form processing into a Django form class if your form becomes more complex.

This structure aligns your program with Django's MVT pattern while preserving the modularity of your existing logic.
