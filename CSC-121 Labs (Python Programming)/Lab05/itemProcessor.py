TAX_RATE = 0.065  # 6% sales tax

# The get_item_count function takes three parameters:
#    item_name - Name of item being prompted about
#    max_allowed - Maximum number of items the user can enter
#    discount_threshold - Minimum number of items eligible for 5% discount
#
# This function will ask the user to enter the number of items and
# validate the number entered is between 0 and the max_allowed
# inclusive. The number of items the user enters is returned.

# The get_item_total function takes two parameters:
#     num_items - Number of items
#     unit_price - The cost of each item
#     discount_threshold - Minimum number of items eligible for 5% discount
#
# This function calculates the total cost for the items and
# returns that value.

# The calc_and_display_receipt function will calculate all the
# necessary values and display the receipt. It takes three parameters:
#    book_total - Total cost of books
#    dvd_total - Total cost of DVDs
#    game_total  - Total cost of games
#
# This function will calculate total before tax, the tax on the total,
# and the total after tax is added.
#
# The receipt should display the total cost of books, DVDs, and
# games IF the item cost is greater than 0. The receipt should also
# include the subtotal, tax, and total.
